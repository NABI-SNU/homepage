## Discovering cognitive strategies with tiny recurrent neural networks

Link: [_Li Ji-An et al., Nature, 2025_](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09142-4)

- Introduces a modeling approach using very small (1-4 units) recurrent neural
  networks (RNNs) to discover interpretable cognitive strategies in animal and
  human reward-learning tasks.
- Tiny RNNs outperform classical cognitive models in predicting choices,
  revealing novel behavioral patterns (e.g., variable learning rates,
  state-dependent perseveration) that are missed by standard models.
- The trained RNNs are interpretable through dynamical systems analysis,
  enabling visualization and comparison with classic cognitive theories.
- The framework allows dimensionality estimation of behavior and provides
  insights into both biological cognition and AI meta-reinforcement learning.

## Inter-brain neural dynamics in biological and artificial intelligence systems

Link: [_Xingjian Zhang et al., Nature, 2025_](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09196-4)

- Examines how neural dynamics during social interaction can be partitioned
  into "shared" and "unique" subspaces in both mice and artificial agents.
- Finds GABAergic neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)
  display significantly greater shared neural dynamics across brains than
  glutamatergic neurons, especially during social behavior.
- Disruption of shared neural subspace components impairs social interactions
  in both biological and artificial systems.
- Reveals that shared neural dynamics are a generalizable feature driving
  social behavior in interacting agents (biological or AI).

## A foundation model to predict and capture human cognition

Link: [_Marcel Binz et al., Nature, 2025_](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09215-4)

- Introduces "Centaur," a large foundation model (fine-tuned Llama 3) trained
  on Psych-101, a massive dataset of trial-level human cognitive/behavioral
  data from 160 experiments.
- Centaur predicts human choices better than both base LLMs and domain-specific
  cognitive models, even in new tasks and domains, and its representations align
  more closely with human brain activity after tuning.
- Demonstrates strong generalization: can simulate human-like behavior with only
  natural language descriptions of tasks.
- Provides a platform for testing, falsifying, and refining cognitive theories
  at scale.
