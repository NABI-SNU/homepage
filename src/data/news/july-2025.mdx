- **Task & imaging:** Using 2-photon calcium imaging in CA1, head-fixed mice navigated VR tracks where the hidden reward zone moved across sessions/environments, dissociating spatial cues from reward.
- **Reward-relative (RR) code:** A subpopulation remapped to the same distance relative to reward when reward moved, forming behavioral-timescale sequences spanning the whole task; the spatial (track-relative, TR) map was simultaneously preserved in a parallel, dynamic subpopulation.
- **Scope & decoding:** RR remapping rose above chance and eventually covered nearly the entire track; after a switch, only RR cells decoded RR position above shuffle, and RR firing order relative to reward was preserved across switches/environments.
- **Learning & behavior:** The RR representation strengthened with experience (more RR neurons, denser near reward) and often preceded behavioral updates by ~2 trials after reward relocation.

- In the Drosophila head direction (HD) system, cue salience and familiarity shape the width, amplitude, and accuracy of the network’s “bump” attractor representation, with brighter or more familiar cues producing narrower, higher-amplitude bumps and better HD encoding.
- When cues conflict, the more informative cue (based on individual-specific encoding accuracy) exerts greater influence, and stable pairing of cues improves encoding through Hebbian plasticity at sensory-to-HD synapses.
- A computational ring attractor model with plastic inhibitory inputs recapitulates experimental findings, explaining individual variability through differences in sensory response amplitude.
- Results highlight a stability–flexibility trade-off in spatial representations, showing how continuous synaptic plasticity supports adaptation in dynamic environments.

- Single-unit and population recordings in macaque DLPFC during a set of rule-based decision tasks revealed that neurons flexibly reconfigure selectivity to represent task-relevant features depending on current context and rule.
- Neural representations were low-dimensional within a task but could rapidly reorganize between tasks, suggesting a coding scheme optimized for behavioral flexibility rather than fixed tuning.
- Dimensionality reduction and decoding analyses indicated that this flexibility is supported by rotations in population activity subspaces, allowing the same neural ensemble to support multiple cognitive operations.
- Findings provide a mechanistic link between dynamic population coding and adaptive decision-making, showing how the prefrontal cortex balances stability of memory traces with the flexibility required for task switching.

- Intracranial recordings from human medial temporal lobe (MTL) during a context-dependent episodic memory task showed that population activity patterns shift systematically with retrieval context.
- Representations of item and context information were multiplexed in the same neuronal populations, with context exerting a modulatory effect on retrieval-related dynamics.
- State-space trajectory analyses revealed that the MTL transitions through distinct, context-specific attractor-like states during recall, with these trajectories predictive of retrieval success.
- Results suggest that episodic retrieval in humans involves dynamic reconfiguration of MTL population activity to match the contextual frame, supporting flexible access to stored memories.
