- **Task & imaging.** Using 2-photon calcium imaging in CA1, head-fixed mice navigated VR tracks where the **hidden reward zone** moved across sessions/environments, dissociating spatial cues from reward.
- **Reward-relative (RR) code.** A subpopulation **remapped to the same distance relative to reward** when reward moved, forming **behavioral-timescale sequences** spanning the whole task; the spatial (track-relative, TR) map was simultaneously preserved in a **parallel, dynamic** subpopulation.
- **Scope & decoding.** RR remapping rose above chance and eventually **covered nearly the entire track**; after a switch, **only RR cells** decoded RR position above shuffle, and RR firing order relative to reward was **preserved** across switches/environments.
- **Learning & behavior.** The **RR representation strengthened with experience** (more RR neurons, denser near reward) and **often preceded behavioral updates** by ~2 trials after reward relocation.

## Unattended working-memory items are coded by persistent activity

- **Task & recordings.** Single-neuron activity was recorded from image-selective cells in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) while 12 epilepsy patients performed a **double retro-cue** working-memory task that shifted attention between two concurrently memorized images.
- **Core result.** Both **attended and unattended** items were maintained via **persistent firing**, contradicting the idea that unattended items are held in “activity-silent” states.
- **Population/subspace dynamics.** After a cue, the representation **rotated in neuronal subspace** (via dPCA), indicating a recoding/priority shift without loss of the unattended item’s trace.
- **Decodability constraint.** Identity of the **unattended** item was **decodable at single-trial level** from _preselected image-selective cells_, but **not** from the **entire** MTL population; by contrast, the **cued** item was robustly decodable from all MTL neurons.

- **Resource & integration.** Generated **paired Visium SRT** maps and **10x snRNA-seq** from **10 neurotypical adult donors**, integrating modalities via **non-negative matrix factorization (NMF)** and label transfer; raw/processed data and interactive apps are publicly available.
- **Spatial domains.** Spatially aware feature selection (**nnSVG**) and **PRECAST** clustering (k=18) delineated domains spanning **DG granule cell layer (GCL), CA2–CA4, CA1, subiculum (SUB), retrohippocampal cortex (RHP)** and neuropil composites (ML, SL.SR, SR.SLM, SLM.SGZ), plus **GABA**, **vasculature**, and **choroid plexus** clusters.
- **Gene programs & markers.** Layer-enriched mixed-effects modeling identified DEGs that both **confirm canonical markers** (e.g., **PPFIA2** for GCL; **PRKCG** for CA1–CA4) and **introduce new markers** (e.g., **APOC1** in SUB, **SFRP2** in neuropil).
- **Cross-modality & genetics.** snRNA-seq and SRT **agree strongly** at the gene level, and stratified LD score regression maps **schizophrenia risk** to **CA1** and **RHP** spatial domains.
