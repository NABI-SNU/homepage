- **Methods:** Multi-shank silicon probes + optogenetic tagging of four interneuron families (Pvalb, Sst, Vip, Id2) in hippocampus and neocortex.
- **Classification:** Machine learning on physiological fingerprints achieved >89% accuracy, bridging genetics and in vivo physiology.
- **Findings:** Distinct interneuron families differentially sculpt pyramidal place fields; _Pvalb_ suppressed early spikes, _Sst/Id2_ suppressed late, suggesting **time-division control**.
- **Conclusion:** Cooperative interneuron interactions are central to the hippocampal spatial map, beyond excitatory synaptic plasticity.

## Speed modulations in grid cell information geometry

- **Approach:** Introduced Gaussian Process with Kernel Regression (GKR) to model neural manifolds + noise covariance in grid cell populations.
- **Manifold dilation:** Faster running speed stretched the **toroidal-like manifold** of grid codes.
- **Noise trade-off:** Noise also increased, but information gain from dilation outpaced noise costs.
- **Result:** **Fisher information and decoding accuracy improved at higher speeds**, while noise correlations projecting onto the manifold impaired coding.
- **Implication:** Population-level coding, not just single cells, explains why navigation accuracy improves with movement speed.

## Tonic dopamine and biases in value learning

  alt="Tonic dopamine and biased value learning"
  style="width: 90%;"

  height="400"
/>

- **Problem:** Psychiatric disorders often feature biased future predictions (pessimism in depression, optimism in addiction).
- **Model:** RL framework with **basal ganglia circuit architecture** + dopamine receptor pharmacodynamics.
- **Mechanism:** Differences in **D1 vs. D2 receptor affinities** and sigmoidal dose–response curves mean tonic dopamine shifts sensitivity to positive vs. negative reward prediction errors.
- **Evidence:** Explains optimistic and pessimistic learning in both humans and mice.
- **Significance:** Provides a biologically grounded mechanism linking **tonic dopamine to learning biases** and psychiatric symptoms.

## Reconciling flexibility and efficiency: compositional cognitive maps in MEC

  alt="Compositional maps in MEC"
  style="width: 90%;"
  width="800"
  height="400"
/>

- **Model:** Cognitive maps constructed from **predictive object representations (PORs)** perturbing a baseline open-space grid.
- **Composition:** PORs are translation/rotation invariant and recombinable, enabling **efficient compositional map building**.
- **Neural mapping:**
  - **Object vector cells** = encode POR building blocks.
  - **Grid cells** = baseline efficient spatial metric.
- **Insight:** MEC supports **planning-ready compositional maps**, reconciling flexible recombination with efficient path planning.

## Competitive integration of time and reward in foraging

- **Task:** Head-fixed mice performed a VR patch-foraging paradigm with probabilistic, diminishing water rewards.
- **Behavioral model:** Mice integrated **elapsed time (positive contribution) vs. received rewards (negative contribution)**, scaled by a latent patience state.
- **Deviation from theory:** Decisions systematically diverged from Marginal Value Theorem but were captured by competitive integration models.
- **Neural evidence:** **Neuropixels across frontal cortex** showed ramping activity encoding the integrated decision variable, oppositely modulated by time vs. reward.
- **Conclusion:** Frontal ramping dynamics provide a neural substrate for **value-sensitive patch leaving**.
