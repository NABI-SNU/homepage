## Core Idea

Traditional State-Space Models (SSMs) are limited by slow, inflexible sequential learning.  
This paper proposes that hippocampal memory is:

1. **Compositional** (built from reusable building blocks)
2. **Consolidated via Replay**

---

## Summary of the Paper

### Compositional Memory

- **Building Blocks:** Experiences are decomposed into Grid Cells (absolute location, X) and Vector Cells (relative walls, objects, rewards).
- **Memory Binding:** Outer product of Grid + Vector activity forms conjoined representations.
- **Storage:** Attractor (Hopfield) network retrieves full memories from partial cues.
- **Output:** Landmark Vector Cells (integrating location + relational info).

### Policy Generation

- **Reusable Blocks:** Encodings imply actions (e.g., reward vector → move right).
- **Generalization:** Unlike traditional agents, compositional agents adapt quickly when rewards/boundaries shift, enabling zero-shot generalization.
- **Latent Learning:** Agents build maps without rewards, enabling instant policy formation once rewards appear.

### Role of Replay

- **Constructive Replay:** During rest/sleep, Grid + Vector info integrated without physical exploration.
- **Performance:** Outperforms Q-learning (Bellman Backup), especially in noisy environments and with limited replays.

### Experimental Validation

- **Replay & Ripples:** Home-Away-Well task shows replay-linked hippocampal activity near Home.
- **Relative Coding:** Cell activity shifts with landmark relocation, showing compositional, relative encoding driven by Replay.

## Key Discussion Points

1. **Active Replay:** Must replay occur only at rest, or also during exploration?
2. **Independence of Cells:** Are Grid/Vector cells truly independent before replay binding?
3. **Model-Based vs Model-Free:** Is superior efficiency simply due to richer structure encoding?
4. **Biological Implementation:** How does hippocampus compute the “outer product”?
5. **Compositional Rules:** Can agents learn explicit reusable behavioral rules (inductive bias)?
