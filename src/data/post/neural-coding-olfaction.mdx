*Original Paper: [Neural Circuits for Fast Poisson Compressed Sensing in the
Olfactory Bulb](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Cxn1FpnNvG)*

We explored the core components and results of the Poisson Compressed Sensing
model, presenting a biologically plausible framework for understanding odor
perception.

## Summary of the Presentation

- **Olfaction as a High-Dimensional Sense:** Olfaction is a high-dimensional sense,
  unlike vision or audition. Unlike the clear numerical representations for color
  (RGB) or sound (frequency), there is no simple, straightforward way to quantify
  an odor.
- **Population Coding:** The PCS model rejects a simple one-to-one mapping between
  a receptor and a specific smell. Instead, it utilizes population coding, where
  the combined activity of a *population* of receptors represents a specific
  odor.
- **Bayesian Inference and Gradient Ascent:** The PCS model uses Bayesian inference
  to estimate odor concentration. It achieves this using gradient ascent, a method
  typically reserved for the *training* phase of neural networks, but here applied
  to the *inference* step of perception itself.
- **Biological Mapping:** The model's components are directly mapped to the
  microanatomy of the olfactory bulb, lending it significant biological
  plausibility.
  - **Projection Neurons (P):** Encode the difference between the brain's
     prediction and the actual sensory observation.
  - **Granular Neurons (G):** Form the core of the inference layer, representing
     the most likely estimate for the odor's concentration.
  - **Cortical Feedback (B):** Represents the brain's prior beliefs or
     expectations, which influence perception.
- **Geometric Coding:** The relationships between different odors are preserved in
  the brain's representation. If two odors are distinct in the chemical world,
  they remain orthogonal in the neural code. This leads to significantly faster
  and more accurate inference.
- **Key Results:** The model successfully explains state-dependent inhibition
  observed in mitral cells, a phenomenon that previous models could not account
  for. It also demonstrates fast and accurate dynamic inference, capable of
  tracking changes in odors over time.

## Key Discussion Points

1. **What makes a complex model like this valid?**: The presenter acknowledged the
   model's mathematical elegance and noted that some of the model's parameters
   were indeed derived from biological data, such as calcium imaging.

2. **Threshold for Acceptance**: The discussion touched on the different standards
   for model acceptance across scientific fields. While a machine learning
   conference like NeurIPS might value the model's mathematical novelty,
   biological journals would likely require more extensive experimental
   validation.

3. **Testing with Variability**: An interesting suggestion was to test the model's
   validity by seeing if it could explain olfactory differences between species
   or individuals. For instance, could the model show why a dog's sense of smell
   is more sensitive than a human's by revealing different parameter settings?

4. **The Subjectivity of Smell**: A participant raised the valid point that the
   model treats odor as an objective vector, while the perception of smell is
   highly subjective. This poses a challenge for directly comparing the model's
   output with experimental data from neuroscience.
