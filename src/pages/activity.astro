      <strong>NABI 2025 Symposium: "Memory in Context"</strong><br />
      The core focus of NABI’s current academic year is our flagship symposium, 
      <em>“Memory in Context: Prelude”</em>, a deep dive into recent advances in understanding how memory is 
      structured, retrieved, and transformed within contextual frameworks. This theme integrates perspectives 
      from neuroscience, machine learning, and cognitive modeling.

      <strong>Key References:</strong><br />
      Grounded in landmark studies such as <em>Stachenfeld et al. (2017)</em> on predictive maps in the hippocampus 
      and <em>Whittington et al. (2020, 2022)</em> on relational memory and transformers, our sessions explore the dynamic 
      roles of context in spatial and conceptual memory. Emerging work such as <em>Raju et al. (2024)</em> and 
      <em>Dedieu et al. (2024)</em> highlights how AI models reinterpret classical hippocampal theories.

      <strong>What We Do:</strong><br />
      NABI is an interdisciplinary student-led study group that explores brain intelligence—both natural and 
      artificial. We organize structured seminars, collaborative reading groups, and live discussions connecting 
      computational models with biological data.
